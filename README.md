# Attrition_Rate_Analytics

Customer Attrition is a tendency of customers to abandon a brand and stop being a paying client of a particular business. The percentage of customers that discontinue using a company’s products or services during a particular time period is called Customer Attrition Rate.
The objective of this project is to Analyze Customer Attrition Rate of a Company using Machine-Learning Algorithm. We visualize how each variable is related to our target variable and develop a model which gives the Probability of Attrition Rate of each Customer.
As Customer retention becomes a valuable metric, it is in companies’ best interests to reduce Customer Attrition Rate. Companies that constantly monitor how people engage with products, encourage clients to share opinions, and solve their issues promptly have greater opportunities to maintain mutually beneficial client relationships.
Similar model can also be used by HR's to predict Employee Attrition(Turnover) in an Organization. It’s important to be aware of the implications of Attrition and how to avoid Employee Turnover.
